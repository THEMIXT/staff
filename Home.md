# Staff++ Documentation

## Introduction
This plugin was originally developed By ShortNinja. After ShortNinja's passing QBall took over the support and further development.

I created this repository as an attempt to add new features to StaffPlus and revitalize it.
The first difference from StaffPlus is that I dropped support for the older versions, this will hopefully allow me to add new features to the newer version easily and help in bug fixing more targeted. If you are using older version of Minecraft please refer to QBall's [repository](https://github.com/Qballl/StaffPlus)

I changed some of the core features:

* Support for MySQL/SQLITE db integration
* BungeeCord integration for Staff Chat
* New and improved reporting system
* New and improved warning and punishment system
* Discord integration for reports & warning.

Overall I am trying to fix a lot of the existing bugs and am cleaning up the code.
Hopefully this plugin can be a good successor to ShortNinja's original plugin.
