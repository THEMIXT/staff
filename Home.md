# Staff++ Documentation

## Introduction
This plugin was originally developed By ShortNinja. After ShortNinja's passing QBall took over the support and further development.

I created this repository as an attempt to add new features to StaffPlus and revitalize it.
The first difference from StaffPlus is that I dropped support for the older versions, this will hopefully allow me to add new features to the newer version easily and help in bug fixing more targeted.

I changed some of the core features:

* Support for MySQL/SQLITE db integration
* BungeeCord integration for Staff Chat
* New and improved reporting system
* New and improved warning and punishment system
* Discord integration for reports & warning.

### If you are migrating from Staff+ please see this page: [Migration Guide](https://github.com/garagepoort/StaffPlusPlus/wiki/StaffPlus-Migration)

## Configuration

An example of the config file is always present in the repository.
https://github.com/garagepoort/StaffPlusPlus/blob/master/StaffPlusCore/src/main/resources/config.yml

_**Every time you update Staff++, you should check the default config file and compare it to your config file.**_
